We need to read the records which are related to some package info. 
Package id needs to be validated for id with 3 digits followed by / and 
than 3 characters are considered as valid , only those records should
be read and stored in the database table after performing some
calculations. If the package id is invalid , exception will be thrown 
and called InvalidPackageException which is a user defined exception.
(cusomiozed exception ).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
data is present in package.txt


------------------------------------------------------------------
Let us read the content from an employee.txt file and store it in a table called employee_details.
We will calculate hra from the basic and store it in the table. For employee id , we need to validate as
the first 3 characters should be cts only. Otherwise user defined exception will be thrown.


data is present in employee.txt
User defined exception class is InvalidIdException.  


Design the model class called employee. Model classes represents the business objects. So if we have scenerio
related with employee working in Projects. We will have model classes like Employee, Project etc.

In our example the model class will be Employee. 
We have created a connection handler which is returning an object of Connection.



We are reading from a file and storing it in a database table and we are doing some calculation for HRA and
if the id is not starting with CTS, exception is thrown.
